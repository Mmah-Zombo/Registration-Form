This is a project inspired by a youtube video. But unlike in the video I used flexbox to do the positioning of items. I made the entire form with a CSS code different from that lof the video.

It is registration form built with HTML, CSS, and Javascipt.
The form is not responsive, but has a simple animation (click the Register button to see this).

I Hope you like it.
